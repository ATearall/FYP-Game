To create a game session:
All users download the game, additionally avaiable at https://github.com/ATearall/FYP-Game as a public repo

The "host" should run Client.exe by double clicking. This will automatically launch a "Server.exe".
The host can retrieve the server code, either from Code.txt or the command window of the Server.
Any player joining the server should run "Client.exe" with the server code as the first argument in a command prompt.
When in the lobby, press "J" to allow/disallow new players from joining. Default is allowed.
When all players are in the lobby, press "Y" to start the game.
First player to get their score bar across the window wins.
Have fun!

The server will automatically close after enough time spent idling, or you can manually close it by closing its command prompt window
